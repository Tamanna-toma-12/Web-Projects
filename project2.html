  <td>  <p class="cl2">Competitive programming involves programmers competing against each other to solve programming questions in a limited amount of time. These events are usually held over the Internet or a local network. The contestants of the events are known as sport programmers.
 Contestants solve logical or mathematical programming questions in the coding language of their choice. The number of questions can vary depending on the contest. The results are judged on the number of questions solved, time spent solving the problems, and other factors, like execution time, program size, etc. 
    Benefits of competitive programming There are many benefits to participating in programming contests, especially if programming is your career.
     Prizes Most competitive programming contests have prizes. These prizes can be in the form of cash, software, hardware, free services, and more. There have even been some sport programmers who had so much success competing in coding contests that they turned it into a career.
     Technical interview prep Many tech companies, like Facebook, Google, and Amazon, use the same type of questions in their technical interviews as those you’ll face in coding contests. While you may know how to write code, you may not be familiar with the algorithms and data structures that you must use to solve these types of problems. Competing in programming contests will give you the practice and confidence you need to make it through one of these intensive interviews.
     Problem-solving and programming skills There’s probably no better way to improve your problem-solving and programming skills than by entering programming contests. During the contest, you’ll be given complex problems that you’ll have to solve in a limited time. Many of those problems are ones you may have never run into before. Solving them will improve your analytical thinking skills and teach you more about the programming language you chose to compete with. And these are skills you can take with you in your career.</p>
